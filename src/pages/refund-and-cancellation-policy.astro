  <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
  <p>
    PRASANTA COMMUNICATIONS believes in helping its customers as far as
    possible, and has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this
    policy:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately
      after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be
      entertained if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants
      and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
    </li>
    <li>
      PRASANTA COMMUNICATIONS does not accept cancellation requests for
      perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement
      can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
      delivered is not good.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the same to
      our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be entertained once
      the merchant has checked and determined the same at his own end. This
      should be reported within Only same day days of receipt of the products.
      In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or
      as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer
      service within Only same day days of receiving the product. The Customer
      Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate
      decision.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
      manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In case of any Refunds
      approved by the PRASANTA COMMUNICATIONS, it’ll take 1-2 Days days for the
      refund to be processed to the end customer.
    </li>
  </ul>
